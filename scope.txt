the project is a small game where the user randomly selects a food item
once the random food items gets selected the user gets to choose between 2 questions

should i put ketchup on this food item yes or no

if the user chooses yes: the user gets a random selected answer
if the user chooses no: the user get a random selected answer
after every game the user can play all over again.


create an array with various objects that have the following key, value names
example:

const foodItems = {
        food = [
        hamburger:{
        food: true,
        image: url("./images/hamburger"),
        ketchup: true.
        name: hamburger,
         
         
        },
        hotdog:{
        food: true,
        image: url("./images/hotdog"),
        ketchup: false.
        name: hotdog,
         
         
        },
        spaghetti:{
        food: true,
        image: url("./images/spagehtti"),
        ketchup: false.
        name: spagehtti,
        Good with ketchup: true,
         
         
      
        },
         
        ]
}

once the user chooses a food item it get to answer 1 single question?
should i put ketchup on this yes or no
if the user chooses yes, it randomly get a "sassy answer prefferable a  photo of gordon ramsey coming out "
if the user chosses no. it randomly gets a smart answer returns 



step 1: create an api like object with various foodtitems stored in them with those key value pairs above
step 2: create a an object with 2 arrays, 1 with true and 1 with false answers.
if the item in the food object has a 
step 3 write logic that returns a value
